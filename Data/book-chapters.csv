chapter,summary
"Chapter 1","The phrase in the Intro that spoke to me was: ""We were taught to be independent, self-directed learners. That was not the case for the new kids that showed up. I was witnessing the achievement gap firsthand. Despite coming to a school that had high quality teachers and instruction, the gaps in their knowledge and skill by fifth grade were too great for them to be independent learners without intense focus and support."" I have personal experience with being given support and interventions, but still struggled in school. In my early academic life, I had undiagnosed ADHD which made me struggle with completing classwork and taking tests. However, my school misdiagnosed the barriers I faced and made an assumption that I was an English language learner and placed me in supplemental lessons. As a result, although I was given support, that support was not appropriate in medicating by barriers. This ultimately had a negative feedback loop of falling behind because I was not developing the fundamental skills to move onto the next skill while being passed through the system. Then ultimately, my self-perceptions and motivation toward education hit rock-bottom due to this lack intrinsic motivation as well as extrinsic motivation from teacher perceptions. In that regard, I feel like the achievement gap is due to inequitable education that focuses on surface level connections and not true connections with students on their lived experiences. This is especially true when I know that some students learn more effectively through stories or hands-on as opposed to the rote or more pen on paper approach to learning. This idea is highlighted in chapter 1 with the quote ""School practices that emphasize lecture and rote memorization are part of what Martin Haberman (1991) calls a 'pedagogy of poverty' that sets students up to leave high school with outdated skills and shallow knowledge"". These students may not have the same foundational skills expected from a more ""traditional"" schooling. This aligns a bit with neuroscience where the brain will require more energy and focus when encountering novel experience in this case rote learning, but as they gain more experience the amount of energy and focus required is reduced. Students who do not have those foundational skills will struggle more than students who have developed those skills. Furthermore, teachers also play apart in scaffolding these skills to push them outside their zone of development; however due to bias teachers may not demonstrate this behavior to all students equally. When students lack intrinsic motivation, academic skills, and experience ""lack of teacher expectations"" students consequentially continue to lag behind their peers. In chapter 1, this idea is further enhanced with the quote: ""Classroom studies document the fact that underserved English learners, poor students, and students of color routinely receive less instruction in higher order skills development than other students...Their curriculum is less challenging and more repetitive"". Not only are students presented with mentally unstimulating work, but they also lack anything curriculum that pushes their zone of approximal development. Then as they progress through their academic career their achievement gap is widened, similar to my experience with being mislabeled as an English learner and not receiving the appropriate supports that foster ""independent learning"" skills."
"Chapter 2","The quote that stood out to me was, ""By third grade, many culturally and linguistically diverse students are one or more years behind in reading. We know that each year they will fall further behind in both advanced reading skills and content knowledge because of the system's failure to prevent or close small learning gaps in earlier grades. By middle school, most schools don't know how to address struggling seventh and eighth graders with basic decoding and low fluency problems in reading."" As someone who has been personally impacted by this, I recognize what a deep impact the different social systems have on student outcomes. Whether its the child's direct environment like family, school, or political practices there is always areas of implicit and explicit bias that create a domino affect of disadvantage. Especially knowing how historical policy has trapped families in a cycle of poverty and peoples perception on poverty. For example, the example where there was a teacher that said people in poverty don't invest in education supplies, I've personally experienced, and have meet friends and families who sacrificed a lot to provide opportunities for their families. So it was surprising to see a training course that perpetuated a stereotype that people in poverty don't invest in education. Additionally. how students are assessed come with biases in how ""knowledge"" is evaluated. For example, the book mentions, due to no child left behind, teachers teach to the test and not the acquisition of knowledge. That's to say, what are these test actually measuring? Is it just knowledge of a particular subject? Is it a generalization of their knowledge? Additionally, is this particular knowledge biased towards students in terms of specificity (e.g. regional terms, history, or knowledge)? I say this because often times rote memorization of facts does not generalize to real world application. For example, I remember reading about child street vendors exceling at calculating change to give to customers, but do not demonstrating those skills in an academic setting and vise versa. Who is to say these test are evaluating knowledge of math? This can be applied with other subjects in school. Do students lack knowledge of history just because they have knowledge of a different culture? What biases exist in how these test were created and who are they directed towards? I believe its important as teachers to know and identify the intersection between what students know and what we teach. Because when students are not taught the knowledge of the ""majority"" and are pushed through the system they will continue to fall behind while having what they do know largely unacknowledged."
"Chapter 3","The quote that stood out to me was ""Even if the environment isn't hostile but simply unwelcoming, the brain doesn't produce enough oxytocin and begins to experience anxiety."" This highlights the importance of uncovering any implicit bias one may hold that may hinder connection one forms with others. Even with knowledge of ones implicit bias, one must recognize that social connection behaviors may vary from culture to culture and person to person. For example, the book discuss microaggressions and highlights how it can lead to a someone to retreat and feel unsafe in an environment. I appreciate how the author reminds us that we should stay student focused and understand that each child is unique and that we should become more empathic and entuned with how our actions impact them. Thus we can create a caring community to welcome them into an environment that is conducive to learning. Furthermore, another idea that stood out was how the author connects culture to neural pathways. Particularly with neural pruning and schemas. To author mentions how some cultures have strong oral tradition and that facilitates learning through social engagement. Students with oral tradition will have the neural pathways to learn from that, but when they go to school they might not have the same opportunities to learn from a style that they have developed neural pathways for. As a result they may fall behind as they build up the skills and schema through learning through methods they have not experienced. This highlights they need to really know and understand the differences between your students and provide opportunities so they have more equitable access to education. Furthermore, supporting multiple learners is not only more equitable, but providing multiple ways to ingest information will expand the schema of all students. As a result students will have more tools that allow them to become independent learners."
"Chapter 4","One of the things that stood out about the chapter was the notion that learning about one's own culture is more challenging than learning about others. That gave me an ""aha!"" moment about how I'm often unable to identify and explain many of my own culture's norms. It made me realize that I need to first identify my own cultural lens so I can better understand how I view and interpret cultural behaviors that are outside my norms. I found it helpful how the author references a strategy that describes, interprets, and evaluates the behavior of others. I was able to practice that skill by evaluating my parents' behaviors. It gave me an opportunity to take their perspective and think of it from their cultural lens. In addition to this strategy, I appreciated how the author provides multiple strategies to be more mindful of implicit bias by reflecting on how one reacts to a behavior. For instance, the story of the teacher who asked a student if they wanted to sit down and interpreting their response as defiance comes to mind. This example highlights how our brains can often work against us and assume ill intent because it's easier. Therefore, it's important to label charged emotions a teacher experiences toward a student and identify why they feel that way. For example, the book mentions negativity bias and how the brain has a propensity toward negative experiences. Did the student intentionally act out, or was it a conflict of cultural norms? Its important for teachers to take a pause and evaluate the interaction and not make any assumptions."
"Chapter 5","One of the quotes that stood out was: ""Because there's trust, the teacher can provide a degree of 'push' or challenge without having the student experience an 'amygdala hijack' and either withdraw or become defensive."" This reminds me of my own experiences with teachers. When I didn't have a deep connection with them, I interpreted their critiques as attacks instead of constructive feedback. It's important for teachers to know their students so they can structure feedback that is receptive. This brings back the point from previous chapters on how a student interpretation is what matters, and teachers should be cognizant of individual and cultural differences. Without rapport and teacher perspective taking, I couldn't reflect on their feedback to improve. On the topic of trust, I found the trust generators to be very helpful, especially ""selective vulnerability."" I've noticed how connected I feel with colleagues when they share their stories and lived experiences. As a teacher, I found it easier to connect with students when I demonstrated ""competence"" and showed ""concern"" for their career goals. By utilizing these trust generators, I realized why I was able connect more closely with students. Beyond the importance of trust, another key point was learning about the effect of cortisol on a student's ability to learn. When a student has elevated levels of cortisol, they stop learning for 20 minutes, and their cortisol can remain high for up to 3 hours. This highlights the importance of empathy and cultural exposure in creating a positive learning environment."
"Chapter 6","The ideas in Hammond and Jackson (2015) resonated with me, particularly the passages describing students' defensive behaviors. The authors highlight how students may pretend not to care when they struggle with complex tasks, feigning disinterest to avoid appearing ""dumb"" (p. 90). This reflects own experience, I used a similar coping mechanism to hide my own learning gaps. This created a negative feedback loop where I continued to fall behind, underscoring the importance of intervening to prevent students from developing ""learned helplessness"" (p. 91). Additionally, the authors suggest teachers should be mindful of the intervention strategies they use, such as avoiding overemphasizing compliance or providing remedial content that is not sufficiently challenging (p. 91). In my experience, I was constantly given unchallenging remedial content that failed to address my deficits. This, coupled with my undiagnosed disability, reinforced my learned helplessness. As a result, I (unconsciously) felt I had reached my limit and stopped trying out of fear. This connects with another quote, ""working on these weak areas will definitely trigger the amygdala's fight or flight response in the client's brain, leading to defensive behaviors such as acting out or shutting down...taking on these tasks will test their bond"" (p. 93). This helped me understand my own experiences, although I was receiving assistances, the I received often fell on deaf ears because I didn't have a strong bond with any of my teachers nor were my teachers attuned to my ability and confidence. Additionally, these remedial task didn't truly developed independent learning skills. I, at the time, didn't understand the benchmarks I needed to hit to proceed to the next level nor did I have input in the targets I was trying to hit. This leads me to ask, would the remedial content have helped if I had a trusting relationship with my teachers, or did I need reciprocal and individualized instruction as well? As an educator, I want to be more aware of how to build trust with my students, provide culturally sensitive instruction, and create a curriculum that truly helps them overcome their challenges."
"Chapter 7","The sentence from Hammond and Jackson (2015) that stood out to me was: ""The student who is a struggling reader in seventh grade might believe he is just a slow learner. He isn't aware of the policies and practices that led to poor reading instruction in second grade, with no interventions to close his learning gaps before he moved to third grade"" (p. 112). This reminds me of my own experience of falling through the cracks of the education system. Like the student in this example, I struggled with ADHD and received no intervention, which caused me to fall behind in expected skills for my grade. For example, I struggled with English literacy which resulted with my being placed in English Language Learner courses despite English being my only language. Because I didn't have appropriate intervention and I was passed to the next grade, those gaps continued to widen. Over time, I developed a negative mindset, zoning out and shutting down in class as a way to cope. As mentioned in the book, I didn't overcome this mindset until I believed I could succeed, understood that growth required effort, saw the value in the work, and felt like a contributing member among my peers. Once my mindset shifted, I moved from avoiding challenges to embracing them. This shift allowed me to become an independent learner who actively sought strategies to overcome obstacles while learning."
"Chapter 8","In Chapter 8 of Culturally Responsive Teaching & the Brain by Zaretta Hammond (2014), she writes, ""The cognitively rich will only get academically richer, while the cognitively poor will get academically poorer, as small differences in learning abilities, such as information processing, grow into large gaps"" (p. 125). This quote resonates with my experience as someone who was considered ""cognitively poor"" and lacked the resources to close the gap, unlike my ""cognitively rich"" peers. For example, I envied their access to free tutoring, mentorship, ACT and SAT prep, enrichment programs, field trips, and sponsored college applications. In contrast, my (""cognitively poor"") peers and I received remedial busywork and were often spoon-fed answers. As a result, we never developed the skills to become independent learners. For myself, it wasn't until college, where I took fewer classes, that I began to build those skills. The concept of building intellectual capacity, discussed on pages 128-132, aligns with my experience. With a lighter workload, I had the time to process information more deeply and improve my test-taking skills. Over time, I became more confident and better at identifying important information, which reinforced my ability to learn and retain new information. This experience has given me a deep appreciation for a teachers ability to scaffold students into becoming independent learners while being culturally competent."
"Chapter 9 and Epilogue","The quote in Chapter 9 of Culturally Responsive Teaching & the Brain by Zaretta Hammond (2014) that stood out to me was, ""When routines and procedures are carefully taught, modeled, and established in the classroom, children know what's expected of them and how to do certain things on their own. Having these predictable patterns in place allow teachers to spend more time in meaningful instruction and aids social cooperation in the classroom."" (p. 146) This quote resonates with my work in Extensive Support Needs (ESN), where creating predictable schedules and environments is crucial for students. We use natural or contextual cues to help students develop anticipatory knowledge. My mentor teacher argues that this approach promotes independence, reduces the need for prompting, minimizes behavioral issues, and serves as a valuable tool for supporting English language learners. I have observed firsthand how a set routine helps new students acclimate by observing their peers and how it supports language acquisition in the classroom. However, my mentor teacher also emphasizes the importance of students becoming flexible with their routines and not expecting precision every time. This highlights the need for adaptability in real-world settings outside the classroom. For example, busing routines are subject to variability and change, so students must become comfortable with variance to equip them for independence. Therefore, in addition to having a predictable schedule, providing opportunities in the classroom to practice adaptation skills is critical for their ability to gain independence and self-efficacy."
