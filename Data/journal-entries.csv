"Dual Coding Theory and Multimodal Learning for English Language Learners","2025-08-30","This week, I explored the concept of Dual Coding Theory and its role in enhancing vocabulary acquisition for English language learners. Although I have applied this principle in special education by pairing icons with verbal communication, I had not examined the underlying research until this week. The logic behind this approach is was sensible and studies support it, using multiple information inputs improves knowledge encoding, enhances retention, and reduces cognitive overload.

However, I also found research that observed conflicting perceived outcomes of this method, which are often influenced by student characteristics or instructional approaches. In interviews, some students reported increased motivation, deeper impressions of words, and a stronger ability to form associations through multimodal learning. Other students, however, found the approach to be more time-consuming and distracting.

These findings underscore the benefits of dual coding while also highlighting the importance of using meaningful multimodal stimuli to minimize time inefficiencies and distractions. This is consistent with my clinical experience, where my mentor emphasized the need for consistent visual icons in special education classrooms.","dual coding theory; multimodal learning; English language learners; special education"
"Dyslexia, the Prison Pipeline, and Advocacy Challenges","2025-08-24","One of the most interesting things I learned this week was how common dyslexia is, according to the CBS video we watched, a fifth of the population experiences dyslexia. Furthermore, it was especially surprising that half of the prison population had dyslexia. This really sheds light on the idea of the literacy-to-prison pipeline we learned about in class.

Another surprising concept was the notion that dyslexia runs in families. This raises several questions: How might a student be impacted if they are born with dyslexia and live in an environment with factors that also increase their likelihood of ending up in the prison pipeline? What if they don't have the support to accommodate their dyslexia?

The following sessions paired nicely with the dyslexia unit. I learned that dyslexia is not a listed disability under the IDEA; instead, it's considered a specific learning disability. Because of this, there are many nuances in how a student gets a diagnosis and whether they qualify for an IEP or 504 plan.","dyslexia; prison pipeline; IDEA; IEP; 504 plan; advocacy"
"Vulnerability, Perfectionism, and Intellectual Curiosity","2025-08-16","One thing I found helpful this week was learning about vulnerability and how often we numb ourselves to it. I found the idea that when we numb one emotion, we numb multiple emotions, and how that affects our coping mechanisms, especially interesting. For example, when we strive for perfection in ourselves and our children, we can negatively impact both our mental health and theirs.

This general idea came up in discussions with my colleagues, where we discussed how correctness creates an environment where students are afraid to make mistakes, damaging their intellectual curiosity. We also discussed how this leads to a fixed mindset, widening the gap between students in environments that foster intellectual curiosity.

Pairing this with the reflective listening exercise, I realized how crucial it is to create warm, welcoming spaces free from judgment. By being vulnerable and actively listening, we learned how comforting it is to have our feelings acknowledged.","vulnerability; perfectionism; intellectual curiosity; fixed mindset; reflective listening"
"Teacher Biases, Empathy, and Cultural Awareness","2025-08-02","This week, I learned about how different biases can impact teachers. The 'curse of knowledge' really stood out. This is when a teacher assumes students have the background knowledge to understand a topic, which can highlight an inability to understand a student's zone of proximal development.

Additionally, I've witnessed how survivorship bias and confirmation bias can impact a student. I've seen teachers use success stories of similar students to overlook a student's struggles. I've seen teachers say a student didn't need accommodations because other students like them didn't.

Other than that, I enjoyed learning about other people's cultures during the 'Who am I?' presentations. Particularly how anti-caste system Indians use their father's and/or mother's name for their last name.","teacher bias; curse of knowledge; zone of proximal development; survivorship bias; cultural awareness"
"The Nuances of ADHD Diagnosis and Intervention","2025-07-25","One thing I learned this week was about the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses in eastern states. It calls into question the granularity of what populations are being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. It reminds me of a therapist I've talked to who mentions people of color are often misdiagnosed because cultural experiences are not accounted for.

Do these students have ADHD, or are they being misdiagnosed? It reminds me of students I've worked with in special ed that get put on medication due to behavior problems who lose all their personality and become very compliant. Are we supporting students with ADHD? Or are we using ADHD as an excuse to force students to become compliant?

Another point that I found interesting during our discussion is whether medication is age-appropriate. Are we expecting preschool children to sit for long periods of time and labeling them as misbehaving if they don't?","ADHD; diagnosis; intervention; medication; cultural bias; behavior management"
"TPEs, Adaptive Technology, and Professional Growth","2025-07-19","One of the things I learned this week is the 'teacher performance expectations' (TPEs) and the competencies that are expected of incoming teachers. Specifically, sections 1.4 and 4.4 mention a multi-tiered system of supports, which is something I referenced in a discussion post.

One thing I'm excited about that was mentioned in the TPEs is the use of adaptive technology. Through experience working with medically fragile students who require various adaptations involving switches, I often find myself collaborating with teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and adapted P.E. teachers to adapt activities.

By reviewing the TPEs, I was able to identify what I have done and areas where I need to develop. Although the document is dense, I enjoy skimming through to find areas of strength/experience or areas of deficit/growth.","TPEs; teacher performance expectations; adaptive technology; multi-tiered support; professional growth"
