"TPA Components and Assumed Competence in Teaching Practice","2025-09-19","One of the key takeaways for me this week was gaining a deeper understanding of the various components of the TPA. While it was a bit nerve wracking to hear that there won't be any examples to learn from, I found it reassuring that the scoring will be slightly more flexible, given that it's a new process. Additionally, It was really helpful to learn how the grading system works and how to use the assessment guide. I was able to use the guide to reflect on my teaching practice. I've been using the guide to reflect on my instruction, for example, I've been using it to assess myself through the lens of an evaluator. This will allow me to ensure I'm integrating expected teacher competencies such as focusing on the strengths my students and how to build on those strengths.

This has also been beneficial as I continue leading more lessons in the classroom. I've started to notice the areas where students are thriving and the areas where different instructional approaches might help them access the content. For instance, I've been using the framework of levels of support, starting with the least amount depending on student needs. I'll begin with a visual aid and then move towards more direct instruction. I've noticed that support staff and I tend to default to direct instruction first, but I want to approach this from a perspective of assumed competence, ensuring I'm always starting with the expectation that all students have the capacity to succeed, and that it's my role to create the conditions for them to thrive.","TPA; teaching performance assessment; assumed competence; levels of support; teacher competencies; self-reflection; visual aids; direct instruction; student strengths"
"Teacher Action Research and Career Path Reflection","2025-09-12","This week's session on teacher action research reminded me of my passion for education research. During my bachelor's in child development, I read hundreds of research papers and wanted to be a researcher at one point. That background helped me reflect on a study about small group discussions during the session, and I reflect on moments where I implemented those strategies. This reflection brought back my joy for education research.

While life took me through different opportunities that shifted me away from education, I've slowly made my way back. Between this session and my experience collecting data for IEPs, I'm excited about education research again. However, I'm at a crossroads, I enjoy teaching special education and conducting research, but I'm also interested in administration where I could implement effective strategies on a larger scale beyond my individual classroom. Additionally, I've subbed in many classrooms, so I've also seen how challenging classroom environments can be and how many teachers have left the industry due to conflicts with administrators. I want to be able to create environments where teachers, students, and families can thrive and feel supported. As I consider these different paths, I'm motivated by the desire to make a positive impact on the communities I serve.","teacher action research; education research; career development; administration; special education; IEP data; classroom management; teacher retention"
"Restorative Practices and the Compass of Shame in Special Education","2025-09-05","This week's topic of restorative practices, specifically the concepts of affect and the compass of shame, allowed me to connect my own experience to my professional practice. My educational journey has crossed all sections of the compass of shame. However, when I encountered educators who fostered positive affect, it developed my self-efficacy and fostered my passion for learning.

This experience impacts my values for special education, I want to foster collaboration between the diverse support staff that serves our students. I want to cultivate an environment where all team members can build meaningful, positive relationships with both students and colleagues. From my experiences subbing in various school environments, I have seen how environments could have benefited from having these positive relationships.

My goal is to incorporate restorative practices to create an environment where staff support and value both each other and their students.","restorative practices; compass of shame; positive affect; self-efficacy; collaboration; team relationships; special education"
"Dual Coding Theory and Multimodal Learning for English Language Learners","2025-08-30","This week, I explored the concept of Dual Coding Theory and its role in enhancing vocabulary acquisition for English language learners. Although I have applied this principle in special education by pairing icons with verbal communication, I had not examined the underlying research until this week. The logic behind this approach was sensible and studies support it, using multiple information inputs improves knowledge encoding, enhances retention, and reduces cognitive overload.

However, I also found research that observed conflicting perceived outcomes of this method, which are often influenced by student characteristics or instructional approaches. In interviews, some students reported increased motivation, deeper impressions of words, and a stronger ability to form associations through multimodal learning. Other students, however, found the approach to be more time-consuming and distracting.

These findings underscore the benefits of dual coding while also highlighting the importance of using meaningful multimodal stimuli to minimize time inefficiencies and distractions. This is consistent with my clinical experience, where my mentor emphasized the need for consistent visual icons in special education classrooms.","dual coding theory; multimodal learning; English language learners; special education"
"Dyslexia, the Prison Pipeline, and Advocacy Challenges","2025-08-24","One of the most interesting things I learned this week was how common dyslexia is, according to the CBS video we watched, a fifth of the population experiences dyslexia. Furthermore, it was especially surprising that half of the prison population had dyslexia. This really sheds light on the idea of the literacy-to-prison pipeline we learned about in class.

Another surprising concept was the notion that dyslexia runs in families. This raises several questions: How might a student be impacted if they are born with dyslexia and live in an environment with factors that also increase their likelihood of ending up in the prison pipeline? What if they don't have the support to accommodate their dyslexia?

The following sessions paired nicely with the dyslexia unit. I learned that dyslexia is not a listed disability under the IDEA; instead, it's considered a specific learning disability. Because of this, there are many nuances in how a student gets a diagnosis and whether they qualify for an IEP or 504 plan.","dyslexia; prison pipeline; IDEA; IEP; 504 plan; advocacy"
"Vulnerability, Perfectionism, and Intellectual Curiosity","2025-08-16","One thing I found helpful this week was learning about vulnerability and how often we numb ourselves to it. I found the idea that when we numb one emotion, we numb multiple emotions, and how that affects our coping mechanisms, especially interesting. For example, when we strive for perfection in ourselves and our children, we can negatively impact both our mental health and theirs.

This general idea came up in discussions with my colleagues, where we discussed how correctness creates an environment where students become hesitant to take learning risks, damaging their intellectual curiosity. We also discussed how this leads to a fixed mindset, widening the gap between students in environments that foster intellectual curiosity.

Pairing this with the reflective listening exercise, I realized how crucial it is to create warm, welcoming spaces free from judgment. By being vulnerable and actively listening, we learned how comforting it is to have our feelings acknowledged.","vulnerability; perfectionism; intellectual curiosity; fixed mindset; reflective listening"
"Teacher Biases, Empathy, and Cultural Awareness","2025-08-02","This week, I learned about how different biases can impact teachers. The 'curse of knowledge' really stood out. This is when a teacher assumes students have the background knowledge to understand a topic, which can highlight an inability to understand a student's zone of proximal development.

Additionally, I've witnessed how survivorship bias and confirmation bias can impact a student. I've seen teachers use success stories of similar students to overlook a student's learning challenges. I've seen teachers say a student didn't need accommodations because other students like them didn't.

Other than that, I enjoyed learning about other people's cultures during the 'Who am I?' presentations. Particularly how anti-caste system Indians use their father's and/or mother's name for their last name.","teacher bias; curse of knowledge; zone of proximal development; survivorship bias; cultural awareness"
"The Nuances of ADHD Diagnosis and Intervention","2025-07-25","One thing I learned this week was about the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses in eastern states. It calls into question the granularity of what populations are being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. It reminds me of a therapist I've talked to who mentions people of color are often misdiagnosed because cultural experiences are not accounted for.

Do these students have ADHD, or are they being misdiagnosed? It reminds me of students receiving special education services that get put on medication due to behavioral needs who lose all their personality and become very compliant. Are we supporting students with ADHD? Or are we using ADHD as an excuse to force students to become compliant?

Another point that I found interesting during our discussion is whether medication is age-appropriate. Are we expecting preschool children to sit for long periods of time and labeling them as misbehaving if they don't?","ADHD; diagnosis; intervention; medication; cultural bias; behavior management"
"TPEs, Adaptive Technology, and Professional Growth","2025-07-19","One of the things I learned this week is the 'teacher performance expectations' (TPEs) and the competencies that are expected of incoming teachers. Specifically, sections 1.4 and 4.4 mention a multi-tiered system of supports, which is something I referenced in a discussion post.

One thing I'm excited about that was mentioned in the TPEs is the use of adaptive technology. Through experience working with students with complex medical needs who require various adaptations involving switches, I often find myself collaborating with teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and adapted P.E. teachers to adapt activities.

By reviewing the TPEs, I was able to identify what I have done and areas where I need to develop. Although the document is dense, I enjoy skimming through to find areas of strength/experience or areas of deficit/growth.","TPEs; teacher performance expectations; adaptive technology; multi-tiered support; professional growth"

"New Entry - Dual Coding Theory Research and Application","2025-08-30","This week, I explored the concept of Dual Coding Theory and its role in enhancing vocabulary acquisition for English language learners. Although I have applied this principle in special education by pairing icons with verbal communication, I had not examined the underlying research until this week. The logic behind this approach is was sensible and studies support it, using multiple information inputs improves knowledge encoding, enhances retention, and reduces cognitive overload (NTU, N.D.). A study by Ziv (2025) reinforces the benefits of visual aids, their finding suggests participants who used linguistic monomodal (words only) had the least recall compared to those who used visual imagery or dual encoding.

However, I also found research that observed conflicting perceived outcomes of this method, which are often influenced by student characteristics or instructional approaches (Li et al., 2022). In interviews, some students reported increased motivation, deeper impressions of words, and a stronger ability to form associations through multimodal learning. Other students, however, found the approach to be more time-consuming and distracting. They argue that multimodal learning strategies need to be refined to best support student needs. For instance, a study by Wooten and Cuevas (2024) found that students who received a dual-coding intervention scored 25 points higher on a social studies vocabulary test than peers who received traditional instruction.

These findings underscore the benefits of dual coding while also highlighting the importance of using meaningful multimodal stimuli to minimize time inefficiencies and distractions. This is consistent with my clinical experience, where my mentor emphasized the need for consistent visual icons in special education classrooms. Consistent icons, they argue, enable students to generalize tasks across different contexts, such as personal schedules or station activities. I have observed that students in the program who come from different school districts or programs often use varying icon sets, which can create confusion for the learner.","dual coding theory; multimodal learning; English language learners; special education; research; visual imagery; vocabulary acquisition"
