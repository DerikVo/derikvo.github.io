"TPEs, Adaptive Technology, and Professional Growth",7/19/2025,"One of the things I learned this week is the 'teacher performance expectations' (TPEs) and the competencies that are expected of incoming teachers. Specifically, sections 1.4 and 4.4 mention a multi-tiered system of supports, which is something I referenced in a discussion post.

One thing I'm excited about that was mentioned in the TPEs is the use of adaptive technology. Through experience working with students with complex medical needs who require various adaptations involving switches, I often find myself collaborating with teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and adapted P.E. teachers to adapt activities.

By reviewing the TPEs, I was able to identify what I have done and areas where I need to develop. Although the document is dense, I enjoy skimming through to find areas of strength/experience or areas of deficit/growth.",TPEs; teacher performance expectations; adaptive technology; multi-tiered support; professional growth
The Nuances of ADHD Diagnosis and Intervention,7/25/2025,"One thing I learned this week was about the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses in eastern states. It calls into question the granularity of what populations are being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. It reminds me of a therapist I've talked to who mentions people of color are often misdiagnosed because cultural experiences are not accounted for. For example, they mention <a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800223"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">how African-American male teens are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia even though they clearly display signs of severe depression (Gara et al., 2023)</a>.

Do these students have ADHD, or are they being misdiagnosed? It reminds me of students receiving special education services that get put on medication due to behavioral needs who lose all their personality and become very compliant. Are we supporting students with ADHD? Or are we using ADHD as an excuse to force students to become compliant?

Another point that I found interesting during our discussion is whether medication is age-appropriate. Are we expecting preschool children to sit for long periods of time and labeling them as misbehaving if they don't?",ADHD; diagnosis; intervention; medication; cultural bias; behavior management
"Teacher Biases, Empathy, and Cultural Awareness",8/2/2025,"This week, I learned about how different biases can impact teachers. The 'curse of knowledge' really stood out. This is when a teacher assumes students have the background knowledge to understand a topic, which can highlight an inability to understand a student's zone of proximal development.

Additionally, I've witnessed how survivorship bias and confirmation bias can impact a student. I've seen teachers use success stories of similar students to overlook a student's learning challenges. I've seen teachers say a student didn't need accommodations because other students like them didn't.

Other than that, I enjoyed learning about other people's cultures during the 'Who am I?' presentations. Particularly how anti-caste system Indians use their father's and/or mother's name for their last name.",teacher bias; curse of knowledge; zone of proximal development; survivorship bias; cultural awareness
"Vulnerability, Perfectionism, and Intellectual Curiosity",8/16/2025,"One thing I found helpful this week was learning about vulnerability and how often we numb ourselves to it. I found the idea that when we numb one emotion, we numb multiple emotions, and how that affects our coping mechanisms, especially interesting. For example, when we strive for perfection in ourselves and our children, we can negatively impact both our mental health and theirs.

This general idea came up in discussions with my colleagues, where we discussed how correctness creates an environment where students become hesitant to take learning risks, damaging their intellectual curiosity. We also discussed how this leads to a fixed mindset, widening the gap between students in environments that foster intellectual curiosity.

Pairing this with the reflective listening exercise, I realized how crucial it is to create warm, welcoming spaces free from judgment. By being vulnerable and actively listening, we learned how comforting it is to have our feelings acknowledged.",vulnerability; perfectionism; intellectual curiosity; fixed mindset; reflective listening
"Dyslexia, the Prison Pipeline, and Advocacy Challenges",8/24/2025,"One of the most interesting things I learned this week was how common dyslexia is, according to the CBS video we watched, a fifth of the population experiences dyslexia. Furthermore, it was especially surprising that half of the prison population had dyslexia. This really sheds light on the idea of the literacy-to-prison pipeline we learned about in class.

Another surprising concept was the notion that dyslexia runs in families. This raises several questions: How might a student be impacted if they are born with dyslexia and live in an environment with factors that also increase their likelihood of ending up in the prison pipeline? What if they don't have the support to accommodate their dyslexia?

The following sessions paired nicely with the dyslexia unit. I learned that dyslexia is not a listed disability under the IDEA; instead, it's considered a specific learning disability. Because of this, there are many nuances in how a student gets a diagnosis and whether they qualify for an IEP or 504 plan.",dyslexia; prison pipeline; IDEA; IEP; 504 plan; advocacy
Dual Coding Theory and Multimodal Learning for English Language Learners,8/30/2025,"This week, I explored the concept of Dual Coding Theory and its role in enhancing vocabulary acquisition for English language learners. Although I have applied this principle in special education by pairing icons with verbal communication, I had not examined the underlying research until this week. The logic behind this approach is was sensible and studies support it, using multiple information inputs improves knowledge encoding, enhances retention, and reduces cognitive overload <a href=""https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/teaching/academic-development-and-quality/cadq-blogs/dual-coding-exploring-opportunities-to-deliver-learning-content-in-now"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">(NTU, N.D.)</a>. A study by <a href=""https://imagine.sa.ucsb.edu/issue/54/2025/effects-visual-imagery-recall-memory-dual-coding-or-depth-processing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ziv (2025)</a> reinforces the benefits of visual aids, their finding suggests participants who used linguistic monomodal (words only) had the least recall compared to those who used visual imagery or dual encoding.

However, I also found research that observed conflicting perceived outcomes of this method, which are often influenced by student characteristics or instructional approaches <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8963493/#S8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">(Li et al., 2022)</a>. In interviews, some students reported increased motivation, deeper impressions of words, and a stronger ability to form associations through multimodal learning. Other students, however, found the approach to be more time-consuming and distracting. They argue that multimodal learning strategies need to be refined to best support student needs. For instance, a study by <a href=""https://ir.ung.edu/files/pdf?fileid=e69ea02f-d90f-45f0-8356-70ddd1f26fd8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wooten and Cuevas (2024)</a> found that students who received a dual-coding intervention scored 25 points higher on a social studies vocabulary test than peers who received traditional instruction.

These findings underscore the benefits of dual coding while also highlighting the importance of using meaningful multimodal stimuli to minimize time inefficiencies and distractions. This is consistent with my clinical experience, where my mentor emphasized the need for consistent visual icons in special education classrooms. Consistent icons, they argue, enable students to generalize tasks across different contexts, such as personal schedules or station activities. I have observed that students in the program who come from different school districts or programs often use varying icon sets, which can create confusion for the learner.",dual coding theory; multimodal learning; English language learners; special education; research; visual imagery; vocabulary acquisition
Restorative Practices and the Compass of Shame in Special Education,9/5/2025,"This week's topic of restorative practices, specifically the concepts of affect and the compass of shame, allowed my to connect my own experience to my professional practice. My educational journey has crossed all sections of the compass of shame. However, when I encountered educators who fostered positive affect, it developed my self-efficacy and fostered my passion for learning.

This experience impacts my values for special education, I want to foster collaboration between the diverse support staff that serves our students. I want cultivate an environment where all team members can build meaningful, positive relationships with both students and colleagues. From my experiences subbing in various school environments, I have seen how environments could have benefited from having these positive relationships.

My goal is to incorporate restorative practices to create an environment where staff support and value both each other and their students.",restorative practices; compass of shame; positive affect; self-efficacy; collaboration; team relationships; special education
Teacher Action Research and Career Path Reflection,9/12/2025,"This week's session on teacher action research reminded me of my passion for education research. During my bachelor's in child development, I read hundreds of research papers and wanted to be a researcher at one point. That background helped me reflect on a study about small group discussions during the session, and I reflect on moments where I implemented those strategies. This reflection brought back my joy for education research.

While life took me through different opportunities that shifted me away from education, I've slowly made my way back. Between this session and my experience collecting data for IEPs, I'm excited about education research again. However, I'm at a crossroads, I enjoy teaching special education and conducting research, but I'm also interested in administration where I could implement effective strategies on a larger scale beyond my individual classroom. Additionally, I've subbed in many classrooms, so I've also seen how dysfunctional some classrooms can be and how many teachers have left the industry due to conflicts with administrators. I want to be able to create environments where teachers, students, and families can thrive and feel supported. As I consider these different paths, I'm motivated by the desire to make a positive impact on the communities I serve.",teacher action research; education research; career development; administration; special education; IEP data; classroom management; teacher retention
TPA Components and Assumed Competence in Teaching Practice,9/19/2025,"One of the key takeaways for me this week was gaining a deeper understanding of the various components of the TPA. While it was a bit nerve wracking to hear that there won't be any examples to learn from, I found it reassuring that the scoring will be slightly more flexible, given that it's a new process. Additionally, It was really helpful to learn how the grading system works and how to use the assessment guide. I was able to use the guide to reflect on my teaching practice. I've been using the guide to reflect on my instruction, for example, I've been using it to assess myself through the lens of an evaluator. This will allow me to ensure I'm integrating expected teacher competencies such as focusing on the strengths my students and how to build on those strengths.

This has also been beneficial as I continue leading more lessons in the classroom. I've started to notice the areas where students are thriving and the areas where different instructional approaches might help them access the content. For instance, I've been using the framework of levels of support, starting with the least amount depending on student needs. I'll begin with a visual aid and then move towards more direct instruction. I've noticed that support staff and I tend to default to direct instruction first, but I want to approach this from a perspective of assumed competence, ensuring I'm always starting with the expectation that all students have the capacity to succeed, and that it's my role to create the conditions for them to thrive.",TPA; teaching performance assessment; assumed competence; levels of support; teacher competencies; self-reflection; visual aids; direct instruction; student strengths
Social-Emotional Learning and Visual Supports for Independence,9/26/2025,"This week, we focused on social-emotional learning, which came at an especially beneficial time for me. I gained valuable insights into how to better support students in regulating their emotions in socially appropriate ways. In my classroom, we use strategies such as group readings, social stories, and modeling to teach these skills. While these methods are already part of our daily routine, taking time to delve deeper into social-emotional learning has helped me better understand how these lessons contribute to creating a positive and well-managed classroom environment.

For example, I've seen students apply the rules from social stories during daily activities, such as stopping when asked to 'stop,' clasping their hands when instructed to use 'safe hands,' or requesting a 'break' when they need to self-regulate. This approach has been especially helpful when students are excited and need extra support in self-regulating. In certain situations, social stories have helped staff effectively communicate the 'STOP' expectations to students.

Of course, there are times when students forget or become too excited, but I'll continue to reinforce these skills and teach appropriate behaviors. For instance, I look forward to reinforcing where it's safe to run and how to stay with the group as we continue to build on these skills.

In addition to learning about social-emotional learning, I found the disabilities fliers presentations particularly helpful for my education specialist credential. One common theme across disability categories was the importance of maintaining consistent schedules, providing additional time, and using visual cues. As a result, I've been making a conscious effort to try to utilize supports for all students. For example, with creating a consistent schedule and using visual cues, I've been practicing this by starting off with a visual cue as well as showing the icon preceding a preferred activity to show them how their schedule works. As before, I was using verbal prompts which would not foster independence (may foster prompt dependence), but if they learn from their schedule they would learn how to transition on their own. Then eventually learn independence",social-emotional learning; self-regulation; social stories; visual supports; independence; disability support; classroom management; transitions; schedules
Family Engagement and Navigating Language Barriers,10/3/2025,"This week, learning about family engagement helped me reflect on my practice. During my undergraduate studies, I learned about the importance of family involvement in schools and communities, but I wasn't consistent in proactively pursing these practices in my own work. The videos showing how families advocated for school improvements and how educators and families collaborated to support student learning reminded me why this matters. I want to create partnerships with families where we work together to support students, not just report information about their children. One challenge in my context involves language differences. Currently, I learn about students and their families through colleagues who speak the families primary language, and I'm learning key phrases to connect with families directly. However, building authentic relationships and trust is difficult when there are barriers in effectively communicating with each other. Many families use a messaging app to connect with teachers, and I've considered using it with translation software. However, I'm concerned about creating misunderstandings through automated translations. Although communication is difficult, I hope the pictures I share and the care the staff demonstrate builds the trust to prevent any conflicts from miscommunication.",family engagement; language barriers; parent partnerships; translation; communication; trust building; multilingual families
Observation Skills and Empirical Approaches to Teaching,10/11/2025,"This week we learned about teacher action research, particularly the role of observation and data collection, which reminded me how educators can adapt their practices. In one assignment, we identified a classroom challenge and researched relevant studies to address it. While I've done this before, I've never taken an empirical approach by tracking data to evaluate methodology or test findings. Thankfully, we have an upcoming assignment to conduct observations in public settings, which brings me back to my undergraduate work observing preschool classrooms. By revisiting the observation process, this will help me build on those foundational skills and apply them more systematically when I collect data to implement and evaluate research-based strategies with students in my own classroom. As I integrate these skills, I hope to test and experiment various strategies to better support students with diverse learning needs and share effective approaches with colleagues and the broader educational community. Ideally, this work will fuel my passion for analytics and teaching while equipping me with essential research skills for pursuing graduate education in the future.",teacher action research; observation; data collection; empirical methods; research-based strategies; graduate education; analytics; professional development
TPA Requirements and Connecting Student Learning,10/18/2025,"One of the things I learned this week was more technical aspects of the TPA requirements. Specifically, how we have to focus on alignment between the different sections of our TPA. This was helpful because I often make mental notes of how to support and connect student learning within a lesson plan, but after writing out a detailed example of how I would facilitate that, I was able to think more deeply about what supports I would provide and why/how that would benefit students specifically. This allowed me to think of ways to build on concepts students have already mastered, incorporate assessments they've completed, and identify ways to increase engagement by utilizing students' interests and strengths. For example, students have been developing skills in categorizing dollar bills, practicing the dollar-up strategy (adding one dollar to the cost of an item), and demonstrating one-to-one correspondence. Building on these skills, students will work with organizing a set of dollar bills to purchase food items they have shown interest in during snack and lunch selections. Students will apply the dollar-up strategy while receiving individualized support tailored to their current learning goals and demonstrated abilities, such as access to a number line or a visual model. As I write this, I realize students should also have the opportunity to explore using a calculator to build familiarity with this tool.",TPA; lesson planning; student engagement; individualized support; math instruction; assessment; building on mastery
IEP Goals and Parent Collaboration,10/24/2025,"This week went pretty smoothly. We dug deeper into the components of an IEP, which was super helpful as I got ready for a few IEP meetings I had the chance to observe. One thing I want to get more comfortable with is navigating IEP management platforms like SIRAS or SEIS. I've seen my mentor use SIRAS, but I still find ita bit overwhelming, there's a lot to keep track of to stay in compliance. One thing that I'm concerned about is the way some IEP goals are worded. I've noticed that some goals are phrased as ""the student will complete task X n% of the time,"" while others use language like ""the student will complete task Y in n out of n trials, given X out of X opportunities."" The difference in wording makes it harder to standardize how we collect data. One focuses on a percentage of attempts, while the other is about a set number of trials. This difference makes it tricky to train staff on how to record data in a consistent way. I see this as an area where we can improve clarity and consistency to make the process smoother for everyone involved. Another area of concern, I've had conversations with teachers where parents have asked for goals beyond their child's current abilities, while other times, parents don't want any academic goals at all. I've been reflecting on how cultural differences and family values play a role in this. As an educator, my goal is to support students as they work towards independence, but I also respect and want to understand the parents' perspective on what their child needs in terms of care and support. Some parents are looking to foster academics, while others are more focused on their child's safety and stability. I'm working on understanding and articulating this dynamic because want students to thrive with the right supports . At the same time, those supports need to align with the family's values and the student's unique needs. This makes me think back to a research paper I wrote during my undergrad about parent satisfaction with IEPs and executive functioning. The research found that while parent satisfaction with an IEP increased their connection to the school (and other studies have shown that this connection can improve student outcomes), there wasn't a clear link between parent satisfaction and child outcomes. This highlights the importance of having open conversations with parents. By doing so, we can help them understand how the goals we set in the IEP will ultimately help their child live a more fulfilling life, both in school and beyond. I'm hoping that these conversations will lead to goals that can make a difference for the student(s).",IEP; goal writing; data collection; parent collaboration; cultural awareness; SIRAS; SEIS; compliance; family values; student outcomes
Goal Measurement and Teacher Responsibilities,10/31/2025,"This week I learned more about how to word and frame IEP goals. In my last reflection, I mentioned my concern about why some goals are written using the number of trials while others use percent accuracy. I was able to discuss this with my mentor teacher and understand when to use one versus the other. For example, trials work better for skills that have fewer opportunities to assess, such as functional skills. On the other hand, percentages make more sense for academic tasks like worksheets. A student completing 4 out of 5 math problems is less reflective than 80% accuracy on a 75-problem worksheet. It makes sense to choose a measurement based on the specific goal. With my data background, I want a larger sample size. I'm torn between having a large enough sample to be meaningful while still being practical about how the data is collected. This is important when there are other priorities in the classroom. Focusing solely on data collection could take away from academic learning. This is one of the biggest pain points I find with being a teacher. There are so many responsibilities that teachers are in charge of that it's difficult to be excellent at everything. I want to excel in academic instruction, curriculum development, case management, data collection and analysis, progress monitoring, advocacy, organization, mediation, classroom management, and being a resource provider and family liaison. This is even more true in special education because I also want to learn more about the technical aspects of speech therapy, occupational therapy, and adapted PE. I want to understand how to incorporate the theory of each of those disciplines to better support my students. For example, when I worked as a paraeducator, I thought about pursuing a career in each of those fields but couldn't choose one. So I became a special education teacher because I get to do all those things, but now I want to essentially get masters in all those fields to better support my students; however, that is highly impractical and I know I need to work efficiently with the other support staff.",IEP goals; data collection; measurement; teacher responsibilities; special education; interdisciplinary collaboration; speech therapy; occupational therapy; adapted PE; professional development
Lead Teaching and Curriculum Structure,11/8/2025,"This week went pretty well. My mentor teacher was out for three days, so I had the opportunity to take on the role of lead teacher during that time. This gave me the chance to gain experience in preparing lessons, writing reports, and organizing a mini field trip. While it was a little stressful since three regular staff members were out, which meant I had to manage three substitute aides, the class was well-organized and structured, which helped me stay on track. Having subbed in various classrooms with different structures, I've seen how chaotic things can get without a clear system in place. Because of that experience, I understand the importance of having clear structure for the school year. What really helped me adapt quickly this week was the district's curriculum (Unique Learning). That structure allowed me to get the material ready and adjust the schedule as needed. That said, it also made me think about a potential challenge for the future, if I find myself in a similar situation but without a clear curriculum, I'd need to manually create lessons and personalize them for entire school years. Thankfully, we learned about educational technologies that can help teachers streamline the process of manually creating curriculum for an entire school year. I hope to bridge my experience in AI and data science to develop or adapt curriculum that can benefit students as well as track the impact of these customized lessons.",lead teaching; classroom management; curriculum; Unique Learning; substitute management; educational technology; AI; data science; lesson planning
Special Education Resources and Classroom Confidence,11/15/2025,"This week went pretty well. We had a special education lecture which provided a lot of helpful resources, especially examples of behavior reports and IEP templates. I have to take a deeper dive during the break to into these resources as I prepare to co-write an IEP with my mentor. Additionally, we had a seminar from the residency program which provided a template to plan units and individual lessons for the school year which was something I worried about. The only thing left is to implement everything I learned when I take over a classroom. Because the classroom I'm in right now is super structured and I've built a relationship with the staff, solo teaching was relatively easy; however, when I move into my own classroom I worry about creating an environment where I am as confident as I am now.",special education; IEP writing; behavior reports; unit planning; lesson planning; classroom management; confidence; professional relationships
Curriculum Software and Planning Confidence,11/23/2025,"This week, I gained full access to our curriculum software, which will allow me to practice organizing instructional material from scratch. The next step is to use the district curriculum outline to organize the content as expected. I had worries about this in the past, but I'm slowly getting more opportunities to practice and build my confidence. I hope to use Thanksgiving break to practice with the software so I can plan out a school year. In the future, I also hope to practice adapting curriculum based on modified graduation requirements (for the high school level) or focusing on vocational skills for post-secondary students.",curriculum software; curriculum planning; modified graduation requirements; vocational skills; post-secondary preparation; professional confidence
UDL and Literacy Development for IEP Leadership,12/6/2025,"This week, the UDL and literacy lesson came at a good time. I was able to apply some of the ideas from the third UDL session to adapt my lessons based on my students' present levels, especially using the depth of knowledge framework. It's helping me figure out how to better support their learning in a more individualized way. I also learned more about literacy development, particularly phonological awareness, which will be really helpful when I'm assessing and setting goals for my students. I'm about to take on the responsibility of leading an IEP, and I think this new knowledge will help me define the goals and assessments more clearly. I'm a little nervous about stepping into that role, but there's a seminar on IEP management next week, so I'm hoping that will give me some more insight and prepare me for the meeting.",UDL; literacy development; phonological awareness; depth of knowledge; IEP leadership; assessment; goal setting; individualized instruction
IEP Case Management and Student-Centered Planning,12/13/2025,"This week I attended a seminar on IEP case management, which came at a good time since I'll lead an IEP in January. The seminar made me realize the importance of getting to know my student on an even deeper level. This deeper understanding will help me formulate goals, write present levels, and identify accommodations based on real insights about who they are. The prompt this week asked me to think about how students can see themselves in my lessons. I realized I can use what I find in their IEPs to make this happen. I did this for the TPA and would occasionally include things I know about my students, but I hadn't been documenting those interests consistently. I now see the importance of keeping records of what engages them, both as a reminder for myself and as evidence for current and future teams. I've been incorporating student interests into lessons in small ways. For example, I used their favorite items when we practiced purchasing activities in math. One of my students has shown a love for animals through community outings and family surveys. When we went to the zoo, I connected that passion to what we were seeing and encouraged them to use their AAC device. It gave them a chance to practice self-advocacy and social skills while talking about something they genuinely care about. Moving forward, I want to keep extending this approach to incorporate more aspects of their lives into lessons.",IEP case management; student interests; culturally responsive teaching; AAC; self-advocacy; present levels; accommodations; documentation
AAC Development and Functional Communication Skills,12/21/2025,"This week we worked on supporting students to use full sentences on their AACs instead of single word responses. This will help students with self-expression and self-advocacy. For example, one student has made the connection to use the full sentence 'I want to eat _______' and is now working on using the AAC as a communication tool beyond just stating needs. We are working with the SLP to add pictures and names of staff so the student can say 'hello (staff member name), I want to eat ______.' This connects to a lesson we did on learning how to buy things in the community. As students build their communication skills along with money and transaction knowledge, they are developing tools for various aspects of adult life including employment and making purchases. We will at each process of the way, explain to the students why what they are learning is important and how it will help them in the future.",AAC; augmentative and alternative communication; full sentences; self-expression; self-advocacy; SLP collaboration; functional skills; community skills; life skills; transition planning
