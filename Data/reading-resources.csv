Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students,Zaretta Hammond,2014,book,Culturally Responsive Teaching,"A bold, brain-based teaching approach to culturally responsive instruction. To close the achievement gap, diverse classrooms need a proven framework for optimizing student engagement. Culturally responsive pedagogy facilitates and supports the achievement of all students. Written by Zaretta Hammond, this book unites the science of learning with culturally responsive teaching. Offering a practical approach, it helps educators understand how the brain learns and how to use that knowledge to create learning environments where diverse students thrive.",https://www.amazon.com/Culturally-Responsive-Teaching-Brain-Linguistically/dp/1483308014,"In Culturally Responsive Teaching & the Brain, Zaretta Hammond argues that achievement gaps stem from systemic inequities and ""pedagogy of poverty"" practices rather than student deficits, showing how misaligned curriculum, culturally biased assessments, and failed early interventions create cycles where students lose motivation and fall further behind. She connects neuroscience to classroom practice, explaining how microaggressions trigger cortisol that inhibits learning while culturally shaped neural pathways mean students from oral traditions may not align with traditional instruction, and building trust through ""selective vulnerability"" creates the psychological safety students need to accept challenges without becoming defensive. Hammond provides practical frameworks for developing independent learners by addressing students' beliefs in their capacity for growth, ensuring they feel valued as community members, and providing appropriately challenging instruction rather than remedial busywork, emphasizing that effective culturally responsive teaching requires teachers to examine implicit biases, understand students' cultural lenses, provide multiple pathways to demonstrate knowledge, and create curriculum that honors what students already know while systematically building the executive function skills and learning capacity needed for academic success"
Unearthing Joy: A Guide to Culturally and Historically Responsive Teaching and Learning,Gholdy Muhammad,2023,book,Culturally Responsive Teaching,"In Unearthing Joy, Gholdy Muhammad offers a framework and model to help teachers imagine new possibilities and create classrooms that are sites of liberation, love, intellect, and joy. Muhammad outlines the Five Pursuits—identity, skills, intellectualism, criticality, and joy—and demonstrates how they can inform our curriculum, assessment, and instruction in deep and transformative ways. She offers activities and questions that help us reflect on our identities, purposes, and hopes as educators and embrace culturally and historically responsive teaching and learning as a daily responsibility. Throughout the book, Muhammad invites us to think more broadly about the liberation and flourishing of our students and imagine schools and classrooms as places where we all experience the fullness of our humanity.",https://www.amazon.com/Unearthing-Joy-Culturally-Historically-Instruction/dp/133885660X,"I am still reading this book, but one of the eye-opening passages I read was about the difference between simply adding ""diversity"" into curriculum versus actually implementing diversity, which the book explains includes ""the incorporation of different ideas and perspectives that have traditionally been excluded."" One small change I'd make is to use the transformative curriculum approach (page 72-73) to intentionally add joy by including the voices and perspectives of people with disabilities in my history lessons, since the reading explains that joy comes from elevating beauty in humanity through truthful narratives (page 70) and students experience joy when they see diverse and positive representations, not just a single narrative of who they are (page 71). For example, when teaching about labor movements, I would add a 5-minute activity where students read a primary source from Helen Keller about workers' rights and analyze her argument using guiding questions that examine her background, goals for labor reform, and how her experiences shaped her advocacy. As the reading explains on page 72, transformation views issues from multicultural perspectives and contains more voices, encouraging students to examine and challenge their beliefs. I would collaborate with others to ensure this inclusion is transformative and not simply additive (page 72), and students would be surprised to discover Helen Keller's social activism beyond the inspiration story from elementary school. This demonstrates joy because students discover depth that expands their schemas about people with disabilities and shows anyone can be an agent of change."

Exposure to childhood parental bereavement and risk of school bullying victimization,"Hailiang Ran, Jin Lu, Qiongxian Li, Yuanyu Shi, Guiqing Zheng, Yandie He, Shuqing Liu, Yi Xiang, William Y. Xuan, Yuanyuan Xiao, Ziming Xuan",2025,journal article,Trauma & Mental Health,"A study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders that surveyed 21,000 children and adolescents in China found that youth who experienced the death of a parent were more likely to be victims of school bullying. The research examined how factors including sex of the deceased parent, age when the death occurred, sex of the child, and urban versus rural residence modified the association between parental bereavement and bullying victimization. Adolescents in rural areas, girls, and older youth (ages 13-17) were at higher risk of bullying after either parent died, with maternal death raising risk specifically among male youth.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032725004549,"This study is pretty heartbreaking. On top of the pain of losing a parent, students also face the added trauma of school bullying. The research covers factors like the age of the child when the loss happens, the sex of the deceased parent, and whether the student lives in a rural or urban area all influence their risk of being bullied (Ran et al., 2025). I'm curious to understand more about how parental bereavement increases the risk of bullying. I also wonder how we can better support these students and encourage empathy among their peers."
Health Advisory: Artificial Intelligence and Adolescent Well-being,American Psychological Association,2025,publication,Technology & Mental Health,"The American Psychological Association issued a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being addressing the emerging use of artificial intelligence and its associations with youth development. The advisory synthesizes research on AI's impact on adolescents (ages 10-25) and provides evidence-based recommendations to maximize benefits while minimizing risks. Key concerns include adolescents being less likely to question AI accuracy, potential displacement of real-world relationships with AI companions, challenges with AI-generated misinformation particularly around sensitive health topics, and the need for media literacy education. The report emphasizes that unlike social media, adolescents may be unaware when they are using AI technologies, making it critical to ensure youth safety through age-appropriate defaults, transparency, rigorous testing, and safeguards against harmful content.",https://www.apa.org/topics/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/health-advisory-ai-adolescent-well-being,"This was a good article on learning about AI and the complications it can bring, such as how people can manipulate things like Google's AI summary by flooding misinformation into top search results. This is important because the article discusses how students will need to learn media literacy to discern misinformation and not blindly trust AI. It was interesting how they bring up that some children and adolescents view AI as a 'friend,' which reminds me of when Alexa first came out. Many children I've interacted with viewed it as a person. Because of that, I was always interested in seeing the outcomes of these artificial relationships, especially with the advent of AI."
The Thrill of Not Knowing All the Answers,TED Talk,2025,video,Growth Mindset,"A video about the importance of maintaining a curious mindset, particularly in challenging conversations or conflicts. The video emphasizes that nobody is ever 100% wrong, and that maintaining curiosity allows you to learn from every conversation rather than simply trying to be right. It encourages viewers to ask questions they're genuinely interested in hearing answers to, to listen more than they talk, and to remember that learning can mean different things - even understanding another person's perspective makes future interactions easier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pry6l7h48ro,"In a world that prizes certainty, hot takes and instant answers, what happens when we celebrate the power of ... not knowing? Scientist and storyteller Harini Bhat shares how she built a mega-popular YouTube channel where curiosity, not credentials, drives discovery. From ancient brains turned to glass to the origins of life itself, she reminds us that science isn't just for scientists — it's for anyone willing to ask, 'Why?'"
