"Visual Supports","Using images, diagrams, and symbols to help students understand and retain new language and content by providing visual context and scaffolding for comprehension.","Visual Learning","Use graphic organizers like mind maps or Venn diagrams; Label classroom objects and walls with vocabulary; Provide visual schedules to help students understand the flow of the lesson; Create picture dictionaries for new vocabulary; Use charts and posters to display language structures","Graphic organizers; Labels and tape; Poster paper; Markers; Digital presentation tools; Picture cards; Visual schedule templates","Dual Coding Theory supports that visual and verbal information are processed differently and combining both enhances learning and retention"
"Multimodal Learning","Engaging multiple senses (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) to reinforce learning by providing information through various channels to accommodate different learning styles and strengthen neural pathways.","Multisensory Instruction","Use videos, songs, and podcasts to introduce new content; Have students draw pictures or act out key concepts; Encourage students to create multimedia projects such as videos or posters; Incorporate movement and gestures with vocabulary; Use manipulatives for hands-on learning","Videos; Audio equipment; Art supplies; Recording devices; Computers or tablets; Manipulatives; Musical instruments; Props for acting","Research in cognitive psychology shows that engaging multiple sensory modalities increases retention and comprehension rates"
"Frayer Model","A four-square graphic organizer that helps students define a word, give examples and non-examples, and identify characteristics to build deep vocabulary understanding.","Vocabulary Development","Introduce the Frayer Model template with four squares; Have students write the target word in the center; Students fill in definition, characteristics, examples, and non-examples; Discuss and share completed organizers; Use for both content and academic vocabulary","Frayer Model templates; Pencils or pens; Dictionary access; Whiteboard or chart paper; Content-specific vocabulary lists","Research shows that teaching vocabulary through multiple contexts and connections improves long-term retention and transfer"
"KWL Chart","A three-column chart (Know, Want to Know, Learned) that helps students activate prior knowledge, set learning goals, and track their learning progress throughout a lesson or unit.","Reading Comprehension","Create three-column chart with K-W-L headers; Have students brainstorm what they already know about the topic; Students generate questions about what they want to learn; After instruction, students record what they learned; Compare new learning with initial questions and knowledge","KWL chart templates; Writing materials; Whiteboard or poster paper; Access to content materials; Sticky notes for individual responses","Constructivist learning theory emphasizes the importance of connecting new information to prior knowledge for meaningful learning"
"T-Chart Comparison","A simple two-column organizer used to compare and contrast ideas, concepts, or vocabulary, helping students organize information and see relationships between concepts.","Critical Thinking","Draw or provide T-Chart template with two columns; Label columns with comparison categories; Have students fill in information for each side; Discuss similarities and differences; Use for various subjects like comparing characters, cultures, or problem-solving methods","T-Chart templates; Writing materials; Content examples; Whiteboard; Comparison topics or prompts","Comparative analysis helps students develop critical thinking skills and deeper understanding of content relationships"
"Action Verb Movement","A language teaching method that integrates physical movement to reinforce language concepts, particularly effective for learning action vocabulary through kinesthetic engagement.","Kinesthetic Learning","Introduce new action verbs with demonstrations; Have students repeat actions while saying the words; Practice commands using TPR (Stand up, sit down, walk, run); Create action sequences for students to follow; Use TPR with songs or chants containing action words","List of action verbs; Open space for movement; Visual verb cards; Music for action songs; Props for different actions","Kinesthetic learning theory shows that physical movement enhances memory formation and language acquisition"
"Command Response Training","Using physical movement to respond to verbal instructions, helping students understand language through action while building listening comprehension and vocabulary.","Listening Comprehension","Give simple one-step commands initially; Progress to multi-step instructions; Use TPR with classroom directions; Have students give commands to peers; Incorporate TPR into daily routines and transitions","Instruction cards; Props for commands; Space for movement; Visual cues for complex instructions; Timer for activities","Research shows that TPR reduces anxiety and increases engagement while supporting comprehension through physical response"
"Body Parts Identification","A kinesthetic approach to learning body part vocabulary where students physically touch or point to body parts as they learn the corresponding vocabulary words.","Vocabulary Development","Teach body part names with pointing and touching; Have students touch body parts as you name them; Students give commands to touch body parts; Create body part songs with movements; Use Simon Says game with body parts","Body part vocabulary cards; Songs or chants; Anatomical charts; Mirrors for self-identification; Simon Says instruction cards","Kinesthetic vocabulary learning creates stronger neural pathways and improves retention compared to passive learning methods"
"Phonics Games","Focusing on the relationship between letters and sounds through engaging games that help students decode and pronounce words systematically.","Phonics and Decoding","Use letter-sound matching games; Practice rhyming games with picture cards; Implement sound sorting activities; Play phonics bingo with letter sounds; Create word building games with magnetic letters","Letter cards; Picture cards; Magnetic letters; Phonics games; Sound charts; Rhyming books; Bingo cards with letters/sounds","Systematic phonics instruction has strong research support for developing reading skills in both native speakers and English learners"
"Word Family Patterns","Teaching groups of words that share the same ending pattern (rime) to help students recognize sound patterns, spelling rules, and improve decoding fluency.","Phonics and Decoding","Introduce word family pattern (-at, -an, -ing); Show examples of words in the family; Have students generate additional words; Practice reading word family lists; Create word family wheels or flip books; Use word families in simple sentences","Word family cards; Flip books; Word wheels; Magnetic letters; Phonics readers; Chart paper; Markers; Word family worksheets","Word family instruction helps students recognize patterns and chunks in words, leading to more efficient reading and spelling"
