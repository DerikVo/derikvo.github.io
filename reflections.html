        <h2>Reflection: Teacher Biases, Empathy, and Cultural Awareness</h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: August 2, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This week, I learned about how different biases can impact teachers.
          The "curse of knowledge" really stood out. This is when a teacher
          assumes students have the background knowledge to understand a topic,
          which can highlight an inability to understand a student's zone of
          proximal development. This bias can also lead to a misalignment
          between a teacher's and a student's learning styles. As we learned in
          class, when students are unfamiliar with "rote" learning, they spend
          more time building those skills. Because of that, they may fall behind
          and be viewed from a deficit perspective rather than from their
          strengths. As a result, these students are often mislabeled as low
          performing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I've witnessed how survivorship bias and confirmation
          bias can impact a student. I've seen teachers use success stories of
          similar students to overlook a student's struggles. I've seen teachers
          say a student didn't need accommodations because other students like
          them didn't. For example, there was a time a teacher denied an
          accommodation for a student experiencing bereavement. This teacher
          didn't budge until higher-ups were involved. These biases and lack of
          empathy have taught me the importance of building empathy and
          perspective-taking in teachers. Every student has different needs and
          levels of resilience, and teachers need to be more understanding of
          the unique support each student requires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, I enjoyed learning about other people's cultures
          during the "Who am I?" presentations. Particularly how anti-caste
          system Indians use their father's and/or mother's name for their last
          name. So some may feel weird being called by their last name because
          it is their parent's name.

        <h2>Reflection: The Nuances of ADHD Diagnosis and Intervention</h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: July 25, 2025</p>
        <p>
          One thing I learned this week was about the prevalence of ADHD
          diagnoses in eastern states. It calls into question the granularity of
          what populations are being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. It
          reminds me of a therapist I've talked to who mentions people of color
          are often misdiagnosed because cultural experiences are not accounted
          for. For example, they mention
          <a
            href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800223"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >how African-American male teens are more likely to be diagnosed
            with schizophrenia even though they clearly display signs of severe
            depression (Gara et al., 2023).</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Do these students have ADHD, or are they being misdiagnosed? It
          reminds me of students I've worked with in special ed that get put on
          medication due to behavior problems who lose all their personality and
          become very compliant, which was brought up in the video we watched in
          class. Are we supporting students with ADHD? Or are we using ADHD as
          an excuse to force students to become compliant? I bring this up
          because I was on the opposite end of this dilemma; I had undiagnosed
          ADHD and instead of receiving support for it, I was labeled as an
          English language learner even though I was only fluent in English.
          Although I was able to sit still, I had difficulty focusing on
          relevant tasks and struggled with prioritizing them. So it comes into
          question: how many students are misdiagnosed with ADHD, and how many
          are undiagnosed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point that I found interesting during our discussion is
          whether medication is age-appropriate. Are we expecting preschool
          children to sit for long periods of time and labeling them as
          misbehaving if they don't? Circling back to misdiagnosis, are we
          pushing for an ADHD diagnosis because we believe not being able to sit
          still is a symptom? It reminds me of the pyramid of intervention. Why
          do people often jump to medication instead of accommodating the
          environment or material? It should go from the least invasive to the
          most intensive intervention. I hope that I can become more aware of
          any biases and assumptions I have to prevent perpetuating inequity,
          such as the teacher mentioned in the reading that believed families
          living in poverty were not investing in education. I hope I have a
          trusted network of colleagues that will challenge any biases I may
          hold.

        <h2>Reflection: TPEs, Adaptive Technology, and Professional Growth</h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: July 19, 2025</p>
        <p>
          One of the things I learned this week is the "teacher performance
          expectations" (TPEs) and the competencies that are expected of
          incoming teachers. Specifically, sections 1.4 and 4.4 mention a
          multi-tiered system of supports, which is something I referenced in a
          discussion post. One thing I'm excited about that was mentioned in the
          TPEs is the use of adaptive technology. Through experience working
          with medically fragile students who require various adaptations
          involving switches, I often find myself (as a paraeducator)
          collaborating with teachers, occupational therapists, physical
          therapists, and adapted P.E. teachers to adapt activities to allow
          students to participate. For example, using switches and devices to
          pour dirt and seeds, turn on watering hoses, and communicate in a
          gardening activity. Then as a part of earth science, we categorize
          things we grow as well as smell the different fragrances of the herbs
          we grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reviewing the TPEs, I was able to identify what I have done and
          areas where I need to develop. Although the document is dense, I enjoy
          skimming through to find areas of strength/experience or areas of
          deficit/growth. For example, in area 4.5, I have experience in writing
          (mock) IEP and IFSP forms, but it has been years since I've done them.
          Additionally, I don't have experience with ITP or 504 plans, so that
          helped me identify my zone of proximal growth. This document can be
          paired with mentor feedback and self-reflection to better align my
          competencies to teacher performance expectations.
