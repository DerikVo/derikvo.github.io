        <h2>
          Reflection: Dual Coding Theory and Multimodal Learning for English
          Language Learners
        </h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: August 30, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This week, I explored the concept of Dual Coding Theory and its role
          in enhancing vocabulary acquisition for English language learners.
          Although I have applied this principle in special education by pairing
          icons with verbal communication, I had not examined the underlying
          research until this week. The logic behind this approach is was
          sensible and studies support it, using multiple information inputs
          improves knowledge encoding, enhances retention, and reduces cognitive
          overload
          <a
            href="https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/teaching/academic-development-and-quality/cadq-blogs/dual-coding-exploring-opportunities-to-deliver-learning-content-in-now"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >(NTU, N.D.)</a
          >. A study by
          <a
            href="https://imagine.sa.ucsb.edu/issue/54/2025/effects-visual-imagery-recall-memory-dual-coding-or-depth-processing"

            >Ziv (2025)</a

          reinforces the benefits of visual aids, their finding suggests
          participants who used linguistic monomodal (words only) had the least
          recall compared to those who used visual imagery or dual encoding.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I also found research that observed conflicting perceived
          outcomes of this method, which are often influenced by student
          characteristics or instructional approaches
          <a
            href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8963493/#S8"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >(Li et al., 2022)</a
          >. In interviews, some students reported increased motivation, deeper
          impressions of words, and a stronger ability to form associations
          through multimodal learning. Other students, however, found the
          approach to be more time-consuming and distracting. They argue that
          multimodal learning strategies need to be refined to best support
          student needs. For instance, a study by
          <a
            href="https://ir.ung.edu/files/pdf?fileid=e69ea02f-d90f-45f0-8356-70ddd1f26fd8"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Wooten and Cuevas (2024)</a
          >
          found that students who received a dual-coding intervention scored 25
          points higher on a social studies vocabulary test than peers who
          received traditional instruction. The researchers reference studies
          with similar positive outcomes for English as a Second Language (ESL)
          and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students exposed to a
          dual-coding intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          These findings underscore the benefits of dual coding while also
          highlighting the importance of using meaningful multimodal stimuli to
          minimize time inefficiencies and distractions. This is consistent with
          my clinical experience, where my mentor emphasized the need for
          consistent visual icons in special education classrooms. Consistent
          icons, they argue, enable students to generalize tasks across
          different contexts, such as personal schedules or station activities.
          I have observed that students in the program who come from different
          school districts or programs often use varying icon sets, which can
          create confusion for the learner.

        <h2>
          Reflection: Dyslexia, the Prison Pipeline, and Advocacy Challenges
        </h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: August 24, 2025</p>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting things I learned this week was how common
          dyslexia is, according to the CBS video we watched, a fifth of the
          population experiences dyslexia. Furthermore, it was especially
          surprising that half of the prison population had dyslexia. This
          really sheds light on the idea of the literacy-to-prison pipeline we
          learned about in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another surprising concept was the notion that dyslexia runs in
          families. This raises several questions: How might a student be
          impacted if they are born with dyslexia and live in an environment
          with factors that also increase their likelihood of ending up in the
          prison pipeline? What if they don't have the support to accommodate
          their dyslexia? What if their school doesn't screen for dyslexia, and
          instead, their teachers label them as misbehaving? This lack of
          screening and support could lead teachers to have lower expectations
          or even punish these students. This reminds me of a peer from my
          childhood. Our teacher made fun of them for reading slowly and paused
          a lot. What if that peer had dyslexia and now feels unsafe at school
          because of it? It's frustrating to see how many components in a
          student's ecological systems can impact their trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following sessions paired nicely with the dyslexia unit. I learned
          that dyslexia is not a listed disability under the IDEA; instead, it's
          considered a specific learning disability. Because of this, there are
          many nuances in how a student gets a diagnosis and whether they
          qualify for an IEP or 504 plan. As an education support network (ESN)
          resident, it makes me nervous to see how difficult it can be to
          advocate for our students because so many different systems determine
          their eligibility and what services they get. I learned from my mentor
          that a teacher can recommend goodness of fit for a program or what
          services a student needs, but its ultimately up to the principle or
          other administrators.

        <h2>
          Reflection: Vulnerability, Perfectionism, and Intellectual Curiosity
        </h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: August 16, 2025</p>
        <p>
          One thing I found helpful this week was learning about vulnerability
          and how often we numb ourselves to it. I found the idea that when we
          numb one emotion, we numb multiple emotions, and how that affects our
          coping mechanisms, especially interesting. For example, when we strive
          for perfection in ourselves and our children, we can negatively impact
          both our mental health and theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This general idea came up in discussions with my colleagues, where we
          discussed how correctness creates an environment where students are
          afraid to make mistakes, damaging their intellectual curiosity. We
          also discussed how this leads to a fixed mindset, widening the gap
          between students in environments that foster intellectual curiosity.
          One colleague shared how their mentor teacher would intentionally make
          mistakes to help students feel more comfortable with errors. Other
          colleagues shared their own examples of being comfortable with making
          mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pairing this with the reflective listening exercise, I realized how
          crucial it is to create warm, welcoming spaces free from judgment. By
          being vulnerable and actively listening, we learned how comforting it
          is to have our feelings acknowledged and how much more accurately we
          can label our emotions as well as rethink our interpretations of
          events.

        <h2>Reflection: Teacher Biases, Empathy, and Cultural Awareness</h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: August 2, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This week, I learned about how different biases can impact teachers.
          The "curse of knowledge" really stood out. This is when a teacher
          assumes students have the background knowledge to understand a topic,
          which can highlight an inability to understand a student's zone of
          proximal development. This bias can also lead to a misalignment
          between a teacher's and a student's learning styles. As we learned in
          class, when students are unfamiliar with "rote" learning, they spend
          more time building those skills. Because of that, they may fall behind
          and be viewed from a deficit perspective rather than from their
          strengths. As a result, these students are often mislabeled as low
          performing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I've witnessed how survivorship bias and confirmation
          bias can impact a student. I've seen teachers use success stories of
          similar students to overlook a student's struggles. I've seen teachers
          say a student didn't need accommodations because other students like
          them didn't. For example, there was a time a teacher denied an
          accommodation for a student experiencing bereavement. This teacher
          didn't budge until higher-ups were involved. These biases and lack of
          empathy have taught me the importance of building empathy and
          perspective-taking in teachers. Every student has different needs and
          levels of resilience, and teachers need to be more understanding of
          the unique support each student requires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, I enjoyed learning about other people's cultures
          during the "Who am I?" presentations. Particularly how anti-caste
          system Indians use their father's and/or mother's name for their last
          name. So some may feel weird being called by their last name because
          it is their parent's name.

        <h2>Reflection: The Nuances of ADHD Diagnosis and Intervention</h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: July 25, 2025</p>
        <p>
          One thing I learned this week was about the prevalence of ADHD
          diagnoses in eastern states. It calls into question the granularity of
          what populations are being diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. It
          reminds me of a therapist I've talked to who mentions people of color
          are often misdiagnosed because cultural experiences are not accounted
          for. For example, they mention
          <a
            href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800223"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >how African-American male teens are more likely to be diagnosed
            with schizophrenia even though they clearly display signs of severe
            depression (Gara et al., 2023).</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Do these students have ADHD, or are they being misdiagnosed? It
          reminds me of students I've worked with in special ed that get put on
          medication due to behavior problems who lose all their personality and
          become very compliant, which was brought up in the video we watched in
          class. Are we supporting students with ADHD? Or are we using ADHD as
          an excuse to force students to become compliant? I bring this up
          because I was on the opposite end of this dilemma; I had undiagnosed
          ADHD and instead of receiving support for it, I was labeled as an
          English language learner even though I was only fluent in English.
          Although I was able to sit still, I had difficulty focusing on
          relevant tasks and struggled with prioritizing them. So it comes into
          question: how many students are misdiagnosed with ADHD, and how many
          are undiagnosed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point that I found interesting during our discussion is
          whether medication is age-appropriate. Are we expecting preschool
          children to sit for long periods of time and labeling them as
          misbehaving if they don't? Circling back to misdiagnosis, are we
          pushing for an ADHD diagnosis because we believe not being able to sit
          still is a symptom? It reminds me of the pyramid of intervention. Why
          do people often jump to medication instead of accommodating the
          environment or material? It should go from the least invasive to the
          most intensive intervention. I hope that I can become more aware of
          any biases and assumptions I have to prevent perpetuating inequity,
          such as the teacher mentioned in the reading that believed families
          living in poverty were not investing in education. I hope I have a
          trusted network of colleagues that will challenge any biases I may
          hold.

        <h2>Reflection: TPEs, Adaptive Technology, and Professional Growth</h2>
        <p class="meta">Date: July 19, 2025</p>
        <p>
          One of the things I learned this week is the "teacher performance
          expectations" (TPEs) and the competencies that are expected of
          incoming teachers. Specifically, sections 1.4 and 4.4 mention a
          multi-tiered system of supports, which is something I referenced in a
          discussion post. One thing I'm excited about that was mentioned in the
          TPEs is the use of adaptive technology. Through experience working
          with medically fragile students who require various adaptations
          involving switches, I often find myself (as a paraeducator)
          collaborating with teachers, occupational therapists, physical
          therapists, and adapted P.E. teachers to adapt activities to allow
          students to participate. For example, using switches and devices to
          pour dirt and seeds, turn on watering hoses, and communicate in a
          gardening activity. Then as a part of earth science, we categorize
          things we grow as well as smell the different fragrances of the herbs
          we grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reviewing the TPEs, I was able to identify what I have done and
          areas where I need to develop. Although the document is dense, I enjoy
          skimming through to find areas of strength/experience or areas of
          deficit/growth. For example, in area 4.5, I have experience in writing
          (mock) IEP and IFSP forms, but it has been years since I've done them.
          Additionally, I don't have experience with ITP or 504 plans, so that
          helped me identify my zone of proximal growth. This document can be
          paired with mentor feedback and self-reflection to better align my
          competencies to teacher performance expectations.
