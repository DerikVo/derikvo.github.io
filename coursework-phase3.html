        <h2>Action Research Proposal</h2>

        <h3>Background and Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          This setting takes place in a high school extensive needs classroom
          serving grades 9-12 and ages 14-17. The classroom is part of the Santa
          Clara County Office of Education special education department and is a
          self-contained classroom.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eight students are enrolled in the classroom. Six have autism (with
          one student also blind), one has Down syndrome, and one is deaf/blind.
          The students communicate with different modalities including American
          Sign Language, Augmentative and Alternative Communication devices,
          gestures, and verbal speech.
        </p>

        <p>
          The classroom follows a structured and predictable schedule. The
          students are seated in groups based on similar abilities and
          compatible personalities and face the front of the classroom. The
          classroom uses adapted materials from Unique Learning to meet
          California Common Core State Standards using consistent icons and
          formats. Within the classroom, the students are supported by one
          credentialed teacher, one intern teacher, one intervener for the
          deaf/blind student, and four paraeducators. Additionally, two students
          have one-to-one paraeducator support.
        </p>

        <p>
          The teacher action strategy, functional communication training (FCT),
          will address two challenges within the classroom: prompt dependence
          and physically aggressive behaviors. Prompt dependence, the
          overreliance on prompts to complete tasks independently, manifests in
          students needing a prompt to use the bathroom, wash hands, and
          complete other daily routines. Aggression is defined as using
          non-consensual physical contact as a means of communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functional communication training teaches students to use appropriate
          communication to access desired items or express needs while placing
          challenging behaviors on extinction. However, additional strategies
          may be needed when prompt dependence develops during functional
          communication training. This action research will evaluate strategies
          such as extended response intervals and differential reinforcement.
          Extended response intervals involve withholding prompts to provide
          students with additional time to initiate functional communication
          responses independently. Differential reinforcement provides enhanced
          reinforcement for independent responses, while prompted responses
          receive only basic reinforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
          This study aims to address concerns of prompt dependence and physical
          aggression to allow students to participate more meaningfully in
          school and community settings. By implementing these strategies, this
          research seeks to understand how targeted interventions affect
          independent functional communication and whether they reduce
          challenging behaviors. The strategies selected are based on research
          by
          <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/14/9/828" target="_blank"
            >Weyman, Ivy, and Kodak (2024)</a
          >, which evaluated treatments for prompt dependency in functional
          communication training and found that extended response intervals and
          differential reinforcement were effective in increasing independent
          functional communication responses while reducing challenging
          behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>
          To what extent does functional communication training affect
          independent communication and challenging behavior frequency in
          students with extensive support needs?
        </p>

        <h3>Teacher Action and Methods</h3>
        <p>
          The action research study will begin in January 2026, after winter
          break, and will run for approximately four weeks. This study will
          focus primarily on two high school students with extensive support
          needs; however, strategies will be implemented and data will be
          tracked for all eight students in the classroom. The two primary
          participants demonstrate prompt dependence in daily living skills, and
          one student uses physical aggression as a means of communication. Of
          the primary students, one uses a GoTalk AAC device (a physical device
          with buttons that generates words), while the other student uses a
          single-message AAC device (a physical button that generates a word or
          phrase) to communicate.
        </p>

        <p>
          All classroom staff will implement the functional communication
          training strategies and collect data. This includes one credentialed
          teacher, one intern teacher, one intervener, and four paraeducators.
          Staff will implement FCT strategies with students throughout the day
          and will track data when applicable. Regular meetings will occur to
          ensure consistency in implementation and data collection procedures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functional communication training will be incorporated into students'
          daily routines instead of delivered as individual lessons. This
          includes naturally occurring activities such as transitions, daily
          living activities (bathroom routines, handwashing), and when students
          request access to preferred items or activities. For students
          demonstrating prompt dependence, extended response intervals will be
          used by withholding prompts and providing additional wait time for
          students to initiate functional communication responses independently.
          For students exhibiting physically aggressive behaviors, differential
          reinforcement will be implemented by providing enhanced reinforcement
          for independent and appropriate communication responses, while
          prompted responses receive only basic reinforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
          This study will use a mixed-methods approach to evaluate intervention
          effectiveness. Quantitative data will track frequency counts of
          independent functional communication responses per day or routine, as
          well as ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence) data for challenging
          behaviors. Staff will track when challenging behaviors occur, what
          happens immediately before, and the consequence(s) that followed.
          Qualitative data will include staff observations and reflections on
          implementation challenges, student progress, and contextual
          information regarding outcomes. These multiple data sources will
          provide evidence for the directionality of findings. Frequency data
          will show changes in communication and behavior rates, while ABC data
          will identify patterns and functions of behaviors. Staff observations
          will provide context regarding the effectiveness of strategies for
          individual students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because implementation of this action research is integrated with
          educational programming and IEP implementation, formal consent beyond
          existing documentation will not be required. However, parents will be
          informed of the study through regular communication via student daily
          review forms. Individual student data will remain non-anonymized for
          IEP tracking and progress monitoring to ensure accountability for
          student growth. For any presentations, reports, or general analysis,
          data will be anonymized to maintain student confidentiality. To
          minimize harm, all strategies are evidence-based practices, and staff
          will monitor student responses closely. If any strategy causes
          distress or is ineffective for a student, modifications will be made
          immediately in consultation with the team.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Sources</h3>

        <h4>ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence)</h4>
        <p>
          An observational data collection method that tracks each instance of a
          behavior. It tracks what occurred immediately before a behavior
          (Antecedent), a description of the behavior (Behavior), and what
          happened after (consequence)
        </p>

        <p>
          ABC data will be collected in real-time whenever a behavior occurs
          throughout the school day. Staff will track each incident on an ABC
          data sheet, tracking the date, time, context, and relevant details
        </p>

        <p>
          ABC data will provide information and evidence about the function and
          patterns of behaviors.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Frequency Count of Independent Functional Communication Responses
        </h4>
        <p>
          Tracks the number of times each student independently uses their
          functional communication response (FCR) without prompting. This
          includes using their AAC devices, using gestures, or other
          communication methods to request items, activities, or express needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Data will be collected throughout the school day during naturally
          occurring opportunities such as: transitions, daily living activities,
          and requesting items. Staff will tally independent FCR on a data
          sheet, tracking the total number per day for each student.
        </p>

        <p>
          This quantitative data will address the research question by measuring
          changes in independent communication. By tracking frequency, we can
          determine if there is a change in FCR from their baseline prior to
          treatment. Comparing baseline rates to intervention rates will show
          the extent in change and provide objective evidence of intervention
          effect.
        </p>

        <h4>Staff observation and reflection</h4>
        <p>
          Qualitative data from staff about student response will provide
          insight on student response, implementation challenges, contextual
          factors, and highlight progress or setbacks. This includes reflections
          on strategies most and least effective for student(s) and reflects
          why.
        </p>

        <p>
          Staff will record brief observations and reflections daily or as
          significant events occur. Regular team meetings will occur to allow
          collaborative reflection and discussions of observations.
        </p>
